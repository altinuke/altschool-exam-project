            This website is my Examination project for AltSchool Africa, School
            of Engineering. In this Project, I fetch my Github repositories with
            the necessary tools of react. React hooks such as useState,
            useEffect, useNavigate and useParams were used. On the Portfolio
            page, I made use of Pagination. ErrorBoundary was created to draw
            out the errors and 404 page was built to catch an unavailable page.{" "}
